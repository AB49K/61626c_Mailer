61626c mail list manager


This was built in response to being unable to find a super simple mailing list software that doesn't want aliases with postfix or any number of unessasary system integrations.

TODO:

1. database system to keep user information.

2. confirmation of subscription.

3. email filtering to make sure only subscribed members can email the list

4. finding the most efficient way to mass mail (how many bcc address can I add to an email?
